ðŸŽµ VinylScope â€“ Explore the World of Vinyl Records
Project Description:

VinylScope is a full-stack web application designed to help users discover vinyl records from across the market. The platform provides an intuitive and engaging user experience where users can browse, search, and explore a vast collection of vinyl records. Each record listing includes detailed information and a direct link to a vendor where the vinyl is currently available for purchase.

This project is a personal initiative to sharpen my skills in Spring Boot and Angular, with a strong emphasis on user experience (UX) and software engineering best practices.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Browse & Search: Explore a curated database of vinyl records by genre, artist, or release year.

Detailed Record Pages: View tracklists, artwork, and metadata for each vinyl.

Purchase Links: Direct users to reputable online stores where the vinyl is available.

Responsive Design: Fully responsive UI optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

Favorites/Watchlist (optional): Users can save records for later viewing (if authentication is implemented).

I might add a community page where people can recommend music to other users and/or give reviews on music.
